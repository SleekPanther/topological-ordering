# Topological Ordering
Finds a Topological Ordering of vertices in a Directed Acyclic Graph

## Problem Statement
**Topological Ordering:** arranges nodes as v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub> ..., v<sub>n</sub> so that for every edge (v<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>j</sub>) we have i < j
- Must be a Directed Graph
- Must NOT contain a cycle

## Algorithm
A DAG must have a node with **no incoming edges**  
Pick a node `v` with no incoming edges  
Print `v`  
Calculate a topological ordering on Gâ€“{`v`}  
Ends when all nodes are visited and all included in the ordering

Keep track of 2 things:
- `count(w)` = number of incoming edges
- `S` = set of nodes with no incoming edges

Set-Up
- Scan through the graph to initialize `count[]` and `S`
- **O(m + n)**

Finding the Ordering
- Remove v from S
- Decrement `count[w]` for all edges from `v` to` w`  
add `w` to `S` if `count[w]` hits `0`
- **O(1) per edge**


## Runtime
**O(m + n)**

## Usage
- **Detects cycles if graph is not a DAG and prints an error message**
- Create a graph as an adjacency list  
`ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> graph1 = new ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>();`
- Add rows for each vertex. `graph1.get(u)` is a list of nodes representing edges FROM `u`
- Run `TopologicalOrdering.findTopologicalOrdering(graph1);`
